--> Overview:

This project uses machine learning models to classify mushrooms into edible or poisonous categories. The dataset used for this classification contains various features of mushrooms, and the models applied include K-means Clustering, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest.

--> Models Used: 
         * K-means Clustering:
                    Used for unsupervised learning to group mushrooms with similar characteristics.
         * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
                    Applied for supervised learning to classify mushrooms based on their features.
         * Random Forest:
                    Implemented to improve classification accuracy and handle the complexity of the dataset.
